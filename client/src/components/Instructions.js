            <h3>How to Use The Portal:</h3>
            <p>
              This portal is designed to make recording your presentation fast
              and easy!
            </p>
            <h4>Uploading Your Slide Deck</h4>
            <p>
              One the next page, you will see a simple form with information
              that is needed to set up your portal. Provide your name, email,
              presentation title, and upload your slide deck. Please allow up to
              a couple of minutes for your presentation to load in our system
              and do not leave or refresh the page during this time! The file
              format for your slide deck needs to be .ppt, .pptx, or .pdf. If
              you need help getting any other format converted, reach out to the
              help desk and a member of our team will assist!
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the slide deck has been uploaded, you will automatically be
              brought into the recording portal! You will be given the option to
              allow camera and mic access. Be sure to select the correct webcam
              and microphone that you will be using for the recording.
            </p>
            <h4>Recording Page Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Now that you are in the portal, you will see your slides on the
              left side of your screen. Please review your slides for any errors
              prior to starting the recording. You will also notice “Next Slide”
              and “Prev Slide” buttons located under the video for you to
              control your presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your slide deck and your webcam video will be auto-populated in
              the video window. Please make sure you are centered in your video
              window and that you are using proper lighting in order to be seen
              in the recording. For best practices on video recording, scroll to
              the bottom of this page!
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you are ready to record, make sure you are starting on slide
              1 and select the “Record” Button.
            </p>
            <h4>Recording and Submission</h4>
            <p>
              While you are recording, you can see the duration of the recording
              below your video screen. Be sure to monitor this timing to stay in
              the time frame that you have requested to record.
            </p>
            <p>
              You do not need to stop recording for any reason once you have
              begun. Simply use the “Flag” for any mistakes or restarts. Located
              next to the slide controls, the “Flag” button is to be used if you
              need to re-record a slide or make a mistake of any kind. Every
              time this button is pressed the system will create a time stamped
              note for the EZAV team to edit the recording.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once your recording is complete, simply select the “Stop” button.
              Once stopped, you can review your recording as well as any “Flags”
              that you submitted with the video.
            </p>
            <p>
              The presentation is automatically submitted to the EZAV team once
              the recording is stopped. You have the ability to download your
              recording if you wish to keep the file for any reason.

            <h3>Best Practices for Video Recording</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Use Headphones or earbuds for recording.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      Use of headphones or headsets for recording is strongly
                      recommended.
                    </em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      Use of headphones prevents audio distortion and
                      feedback/echo.
                    </em>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Please use a wired ethernet connection for the internet or use a
                stable WiFi connection.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      If using your home internet connection, it's recommended
                      that you turn off all unused devices during your recording
                      to give your presentation the most bandwidth.
                    </em>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Find a quiet space such as a conference room or personal office
                to present from. Be aware of background noise such as shuffling
                papers, others speaking in the background, animals and pets,
                etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure you look and sound your best on camera! Here are some
                tips:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      Avoid wearing checkered or plaid clothing as this may
                      create a visually unappealing experience when using a
                      webcam.
                    </em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      Ensure the viewable area and background are clear of
                      clutter and anything that could be offensive to viewers.
                    </em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      Avoid sitting directly in front of open windows or sources
                      of significant light. It is best to choose a place where
                      the light is in front of you and not behind you.{" "}
                    </em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>
                      Place mobile devices on silent, close unused applications
                      on your computer, and turn off notifications on your
                      computer to ensure a distraction free recording.
                    </em>
